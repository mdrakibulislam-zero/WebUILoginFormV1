## What Have I Done:
I've made this login form using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've used the CDN of font-awesome 5.15.4 from CDNJS for use the icons.

A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

Font Awesome is a font and icon toolkit based on CSS and Less. As of 2020, Font Awesome was used by 38% of sites that use third-party font scripts, placing Font Awesome in second place after Google Fonts.
